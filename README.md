Name: Amine Menhich.
Student Number: 041044130.
Project intended for completion: Quiz Site.

Mock-up explanation:

First, I wanted to come up with a creative name that would orientate my design choices. 
My favorite one was "Quizard", which is a fun wordplay combining the words Quizz and Wizard. 
Based off that, I went for a mystical theme using purple as a leading color, along with black and white colors. 
For the fonts, I played around with many and decided to go with Copperplate Gothic for the H1 and H2, as it matched best my design. 
For the displayed answers, I went for a regular "Canva Sans" to keep it simple and maintain the artistic focus on the other less necessary elements.
These are the main points that I want to cover for this project. 

BONUS:
For the decoration, I wanted to push the concept further and added two characters: a wizard and a witch. They alternate depending on which stage the user is. 
If I can find a way to include them, It will be a great add-on. Otherwise, I belive that the core concept is still good enough even without these characters.


REPORT: 

First, I started by going over the feedback received for the mock-up and adjusting the prototype based on your suggestions.
1- I added a button to go back from the quiz section to the main page where you get to chose the difficulty level.
2- I added the score and the difficulty level on the main page as well, so that if figures everywhere as required.
Then, I applied the principles that both you and Rob thought us: set the HTML structure first, while having in mind what I might need in terms of div and classes later on for CSS.
For the resources, I used both the IMDAC and font-awesome to respectively find answers to my questions and icons to use for styling the website. I also used the free illustrations that I got from Canva when designing the mock-up.

The first challenge came from the latter. I first had to find a way to make the illustrations transparent so that it blended well with the content on the website. For that, I used an online tool I found through research: https://www.remove.bg/fr/upload . It was a great discovery. 
I did not want to use bootstrap as I not only wanted more freedom but I also wanted to go through regular CSS function to freshen my mind.
It was a bit challenging to go through most of the concepts again but it was worth it.
I will probably use bootstrap for when I include the JS though.

Finally, I realised once you get started and go past the first blockages (not targeting the right elements, not having the right structure on html or css at first...), the rest follows more easily and the ball just keeps rolling from there on.
