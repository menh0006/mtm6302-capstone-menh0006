Project intended for completion: Quiz Site.

Mock-up explanation:

First, I wanted to come up with a creative name that would orientate my design choices. 
My favorite one was "Quizard", which is a fun wordplay combining the words Quizz and Wizard. 
Based off that, I went for a mystical theme using purple as a leading color, along with black and white colors. 
For the fonts, I played around with many and decided to go with Copperplate Gothic for the H1 and H2, as it matched best my design. 
For the displayed answers, I went for a regular "Canva Sans" to keep it simple and maintain the artistic focus on the other less necessary elements.
These are the main points that I want to cover for this project. 

BONUS:
For the decoration, I wanted to push the concept further and added two characters: a wizard and a witch. They alternate depending on which stage the user is. 
If I can find a way to include them, It will be a great add-on. Otherwise, I belive that the core concept is still good enough even without these characters.
