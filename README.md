FINAL REPORT:

For this project, I first started with the creative part which included coming up with a quiz name and overall idea. This was followed by designing the mock-up on Canva, and then hard-coding it using HTML and CSS. The latter was my favorite part as I was able to go through many of the concepts that we covered during this wonderful IMD journey, and freshen my mind.

Using a mix of the IMDAC, w3schools, and YouTube videos, I was able to find solutions to match the mock-up to the best extent as I went for a pretty hard design, especially with the fixed images that appeared on my end differently than on yours, because of the screen size.

I also corrected some mistakes from the part 3, retrieved my API key and completed the project structure by creating all the required files and branches.

Unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, I was not able to fully pursue this project, but I still had a great learning experience this semester regarding JS (and php in CMS, which I found some similarities between the two) and I am looking forward to the opportunity to learn and practice more during next semester.
